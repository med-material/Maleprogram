# Maleprogram
"Mal LÃ¸s!" is a Kinect painting application developed for kids. It features three game modes: Freeform painting, Paint a picture and Catch the dot. The three modes are supposed to engage kids in moving and can also be used as rehabilitation. Each mode lasts for 1 minute and a new mode is then randomly selected. When no one is engaging with the game, the game shows screenshots of the players who have played it.
